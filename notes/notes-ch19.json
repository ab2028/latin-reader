  "Hactenus Attico vivo edita a nobis sunt": "'The preceding chapters were published ... during Atticus’s lifetime.' As the previous chapter is hardly a satisfactory conclusion, we must assume that in his second edition N. deleted his original ending.",
  "reliqua persequemur": "'... complete our account'.",
  "supra": "in XI.6.",
  "imperatoris divi": "With subsequent emperors, whose deification after death became almost automatic, 'divus' means little more than 'the late'. But here, with Julius Caesar, it retains its original force and emphasises the impressiveness of Atticus’s achievement.",
  "ceperat": "'captivated'.",
  "dignitate pari": "Descriptive ablative meaning 'no less worthy of respect', sc. than Augustus.",
  "conciliarit": "Contraction for *-averit*: 'and has won for him what no Roman citizen has hitherto been able to achieve'—not merely absolute power like Caesar, but also the grateful acceptance of it by fellow citizens. The sentence is strictly irrelevant but was obviously inserted to please Augustus.",
  "ex Agrippa": "For his marriage to A.'s daughter see XII. 1. Shortly after Nepos’s death, the marriage was dissolved by order of Augustus so that Agrippa could marry the emperor’s daughter Julia.",
  "Ti. Claudio Neroni": "the son of Augustus’s wife Livia Drusilla by a former husband. He was subsequently the emperor Tiberius (having also been required to divorce his wife and marry Julia)."
