  "par": "'their equal.'",
  "huic omnes honores, quos possent, publice haberent": "*habere* is regularly used for 'holding' various kinds of function, e.g. *senatum, comitia, delectum*. By *honores* are here meant ceremonies at which the honours were conferred. Tr. 'conferred every honour ... on him'.",
  "civem facere": "It was a long established Athenian custom to grant honorary citizenship to benefactors or potential benefactors of their city.",
  "Phidiae": "the agent through whom Atticus conducted his business with them, as the following words explain. Lambin's conjecture *Piliae* (Atticus' wife) is at first sight very attractiveâ€”until one realises that she married Atticus nearly ten years after he left Athens.",
  "locis": "for the omission of *in* see note Dion X. 3.",
  "actorem auctoremque": "'agent and adviser'. The jingle must be intentional.",

  "in qua domicilium orbis terrarum esset": "a difficult subjunctive. It may be expressing the idea which Fortune had in mind in arranging for A. to be born at Rome ('virtual indirect speech'); but it looks more like a confusion with such phrases as *non is sum qui hoc faciat*, 'I am not the sort of man to do this' (consecutive subjunctive).",
  "ut eandem et patriam haberet": "'with the result that ...'.",
  "antiquitate": "not, of course, true, though Nepos no doubt wrote it in good faith.",
  "quae antiquitate, humanitate doctrinaque praestaret": "attracted into the subjunctive by *contulisset*.",
  "unus ei fuit carissimus": "Notice this use of *unus* to strengthen a superlative."
